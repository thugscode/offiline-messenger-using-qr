# Offline QR Code Messenger

Send and receive encrypted messages using QR codes, completely offline â€” no Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or internet required. Messages are scanned and decrypted using pre-shared keys.

## Features

- Generate RSA key pairs for secure communication
- Encrypt messages using recipients' public keys
- Generate QR codes for encrypted messages
- Scan QR codes using device camera
- Decrypt messages using your private key
- Works entirely offline after initial load
- No data is sent to any server

## How It Works

1. **Key Exchange**: Users generate key pairs and share their public keys with trusted contacts
2. **Message Encryption**: Sender encrypts a message using recipient's public key
3. **QR Code Generation**: Encrypted message is embedded in a QR code
4. **Scanning**: Recipient scans QR code with their device
5. **Decryption**: Message is decrypted using recipient's private key

## Security Notes

- Private keys never leave your device
- Messages can only be decrypted with the correct private key
- All cryptographic operations are performed locally using Web Crypto API
- No data is stored on servers or transmitted over the internet

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+ and npm

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd qr-code-messenger
   ```
3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```
   node backend/src/app.js
   ```
5. In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the frontend application in your browser.
2. Generate your RSA key pair in the Key Management component.
3. Share your public key with the person you want to communicate with.
4. Use the Message Encoder to create encrypted messages and generate QR codes.
5. Scan the QR codes using the Camera component to receive and decrypt messages.
